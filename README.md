Application Adaptive Load Balancing

  Load balancing on computer networks is a technique used to share data traffic
or task load on multiple network links or servers. In Software Defined Networks
(SDNs), by separating the control plane from the data plane, more control over a
network is achieved through programming, so difficult network optimization
problems (such as load balancing) can be easily managed, by using properly designed
centralized mechanisms.
  This thesis aims to optimize the way of sharing data traffic using load balancing
techniques, utilizing SDN technology. The background of the thesis includes the
theoretical study of SDN and the basic methods of load balancing. We present our
proposal, a load balancing scheme that is based on network traffic and available
server computing resources, taking into account the type of applications that are
running.
  In the experimental approach we simulate an SDN environment using the
Mininet simulator and the Floodlight SDN controller in order to study and evaluate
load balancing algorithms. Finally, we performed an extensive comparative
evaluation of the performance of two algorithms (simple round robin and an algorithm
based on network traffic statistics) with our proposal, resulting in additional
improvement suggestions.
